# About Me

**Hello! I'm Hector Selby Reimundez**. You can follow me on [Twitter](https://x.com/Platymek),
or look at my [Github](https://github.com)
or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hector-selby-reimundez-7a5546187/).
This website you're looking at was wholly developed by me!
I used Next.js and React.js and designed all the UI myself.

My main passions are [Game Development](/Games), **Software Development** and **Art**.
This means I'm able to:

- **Design** fun games, including **level design** and **gameplay design**
- **Code software**, not just limited to games, in the following languages:
    - **Game development:** C\#, C++, Lua
    - **Software development:** Python, Java
    - **Web development:** HTML, CSS and Javascript (don't forget, I made this website by myself!)
- Create art such as **pixel art and low poly 3D models**.

If you want to see example of any of these, use the navigation bar at the top!
