**Hello! I'm Hector Selby Reimundez**. You can find me on:
- [Twitter](https://x.com/Platymek)
- [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/platymek.bsky.social)
- [Github](https://github.com)
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hector-selby-reimundez-7a5546187/)

This website you're looking at was wholly developed by me!
I used Next.js and React.js and designed all the UI myself, 
and the [repository for this project](https://github.com/Platymek/PortfolioWebsite) is publicly available

My main passions are [Game Development and Development](/Games), [Software Development](/Software), [UX Design and Development](/UX), and **Art**.
This means I'm able to:

- **Design** fun games, including **level design** and **gameplay design**
- **Code software**, not just limited to games, in the following languages:
    - **Game development:** C\#, C++, Lua
    - **Software development:** Python, Java
    - **UX design and development:** React, HTML, CSS and Javascript/ TypeScript (don't forget, I made this website by myself!)
- Create art such as **pixel art and low poly 3D models**.
