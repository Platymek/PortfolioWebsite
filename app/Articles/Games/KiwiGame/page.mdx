My highlight in this game was **level design**.

    **"KIWI GAME is a game about kiwis. Two in fact. One to be rescued from the evil farmer who thirsts
    for the sacred power of kiwis, and the other to explore a metroidvania-lite map by gaining new
    abilities, braving challenges and outsmarting puzzles in order to find the one she loves."**

    The game was made in Javascript in [Pixelbox.js](https://pixwlk.itch.io/pixelbox).
    It was made for a school project, but also as a hobby.

    ## Inspirations and Premise 
 
    I wanted to make a MetroidVania as I really liked
    [Dark Souls](https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dark-souls/dark-souls).
    It is also a remake of a game which was made for the python console, where the graphics were made
    up of a 2D array of letters and characters which were displayed on the screen.

    The game is a tile based puzzle game in an explorable, interconnected world.
    I tried to fit as many cool locations as possible, and so the game just has a very random yet
    oddly grounded feeling.
    Every area is connected to be somewhat grounded, with little hidden shortcuts which allow backtracking
    to find the game's 5 hidden characters.
    But then certain areas exist like the player just suddenly goes to some sort of demon realm right
    before the final boss.

    The game also has story comic cutscenes which were hand drawn and then digitally edited.
