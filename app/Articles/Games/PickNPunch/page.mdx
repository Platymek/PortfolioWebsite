    My highlights for this project were its **gameplay design**.

    **"A spin on the roguelike genre, where you fight the boss in a boxing match!
    Each of 5 rounds, you will upgrade the boss to give him one move.
    Will you pick the right one to end this ultimate challenge?"**

    ## Summary
    
    The game is a boxing-themed, action roguelike where the player has to upgrade the boss between each
    round of the fight. Once the player depleted the boss's health bar, they then have to pick between
    two attacks to give to the boss which it will use in the following fights until the game ends.

    This means that the main fun of the game is about learning to adapt changing circumstances.
    The boss that the character must fight is constantly changing and this means the player's strategy
    must also always change to suit them.

    As the each round passes, the boss becomes more complex and gains more and more health, forcing
    mastery from the player.
    They must take new risks and learn their options for each attack.


    ## Engaging Gameplay

    I wanted the player to feel **excited** and **determined**.
    I achieved this by designing the game following these rules:

    - **Challenging**: the player must derive difficulty and hardship from the experience, not being able 
    to finish the game easily.

    - **Risky**: the player must feel the need to take risks in order to complete the game, especially
    due to the very relevant fear of permanent death

    - **Fair**: the game must never be unfair or it will cause frustration in the player

    - **Learnable**: it must always be fairly easy to learn what must be done but the answer should
    never be given to the player as it is fun to learn


    ## Main Gameplay Loop

    I made many aspects of the game quite simple in order to keep a focus on the fun of the game.
    One of the ways I kep the game simple was by giving the player only 3 main resources to manage.

    - **Health**: if either character runs out of this resource, they lose the match.
    This is a very simple metric for understanding the risk and reward of the game.

    - **Time**: if the player runs out of this resource, they instantly lose.
    This pressure invokes urgency from the player, causing them to take more risks, which is exciting,
    especially towards the final rounds.
    
    - **Space**: if either character is knocked into one of the walls of the boxing ring by attack
    knockback, they are inflicted with bonus damage.
    This resource drives the player's decision making, bringing a question to every action the player
    performs.
    The positioning of the player is very important, and they may have to not take the oppurtunity to
    inflict damage as it may give them a bigger reward later.
    This resource is also diegetic, meaning it is very tangeable.

    I also gave the player very few attack options. The player can only **walk, dodge, block, and punch**.
    This means that the player **has very few actions, mapped to even fewer buttons** and are organised
    in a way which makes sense.

    **Parry:** If the player blocks with the right timing, they can negate all damage and knockback from
    an attack, as opposed to reducing it. This rewards the player's mastery.

    **Charged punch:** If the player holds the punch button, they can perform a stronger punch with much
    higher knockback. However, this takes longer and is riskier but gives a far higher reward than the 
    regular punch.


    ## Forms of mastery

    When designing the attacks the boss can perform, different responses from the player allow
    for mastery.
    The player may **dodge** an attack for better spacing but must learn when and where they can dodge to.
    They may **punch** to inflict damage and even charge it for more damage but need to learn when
    they can do it and even sometimes where they must stand as a charged punch has a longer range.
    The player may **parry** to stay completely still and stand their ground but must time it perfectly.

    Typically, the player will have to **react** to an attack, seeing when it happens and knowing to react
    accordingly.
    However, sometimes the player can **predict** an attack. This is possible as the player knows
    exactly what attacks the boss has, and know that the conditions of the match affect what
    attack the boss will perform.
    
    Knowing an attack will come up can completely change how the player reacts even to other attacks.
    For example, the opponent has a move which pushes the player across the ring, but is nearly impossible
    to react to.
    If the player predicts this attack will come up next, they may block early or attempt to react and
    parry the attacks by looking out for it.
