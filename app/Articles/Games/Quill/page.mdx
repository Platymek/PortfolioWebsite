    **"A 2D Collect-athon and MetroidVania Hybrid!"**

    &nbsp;  

    The game was made in Javascript in [Pixelbox.js](https://pixwlk.itch.io/pixelbox).
    It was made for a school project, but also as a hobby.

    ## Inspirations and Premise 
 
    My idea for this game is that I wanted to make a 2D platformer MetroidVania, like 
    [Hollow Knight](https://www.hollowknight.com), mixed with a Collectathon like
    [Banjo Kazooie](https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/banjo-kazooie/BSJG7TTSWVJ2).

    &nbsp;  

    However, I was also very interested in games like 
    [Bloodborne](https://www.fromsoftware.jp/ww/detail.html?csm=094) and
    [Dark Souls](https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dark-souls/dark-souls) at the time
    and really liked the idea of the player simply wandering into these unique locations.
    Therefore, areas would not be clearly signposted but would just be hidden around, usually with
    multiple entrances and exits.

    &nbsp;  

    However, since the game is so short - with only 5 areas: a starting area, a hub area, 2 areas which
    branch off that, and a final test area, each with only 4 worm coins - the player does not do much
    wandering.

    &nbsp;  

    I thought I may expand on this after the project was due, but I learnt a lot and wanted to make
    something new using my new found knowledge.


    ## Gameplay Overview

    Each new area has a new ability to unlock.
    These are unlocked using Worm Coins hidden around the level (because the player is a hedgehog
    with a bird on its back).
    Unlocking the ability takes the player to a tutorial room.

    &nbsp;  

    **The player can unlock 3 abilities total:**

    - **Super Jump:** around each level are jump pads which can make the player fly infinitely upwards.
    This seems werid at first, but this was used to create shortcuts around the level to aid in
    exploration.

    - **Double Jump:** the player can perform another jump in mid air.
    However, the second jump limits the player's movement speed, meaning it is more about careful
    repositioning, as I felt that normal double jumps were not very interesting.

    - **Roll:** another game I had played recently was Yook Laylee and the Impossible Lair, and liked
    the game's roll move.
    I felt it was a good way to have the player be able to move quickly through levels and liked the
    idea that there was long coyote time at the end.
    So I put it in my game.

    &nbsp;  

    Overall, this game still holds up fairly well but lacks polish.
