    To create this website, I used [Next.js](https://nextjs.org),
    the React-based web development framework.
    
    This website is only a frontend, with no backend,
    and is made in JavaScript and TypeScript with Markdown
    (*see Implementation details further below*).
    

    ## Design

    For the design of my Portfolio website,
    I wanted to give the website a playful design while also keeping the site formal and user friendly.

    To achieve this look, video game interfaces for inspiration such as
    [Animal Crossing](https://www.gameuidatabase.com/gameData.php?id=606) and
    [Going Under](https://www.gameuidatabase.com/gameData.php?id=613).
    Soft colours keep the experience relaxing but are saturated enough to guide the user experience.
    Corners are rounded, which enhance the website's friendly tone.

    It was important to me to get the website working for both mobile and desktop,
    and at different text sizes.
    Once compromise I had to make was putting the gallery of images at the bottom of the page
    for mobile devices, which some users may find irritating on pages with lots of text,
    but felt necessary to push that these are articles, and images are secondary.
    

    ## Implementation

    All the text bodies of each page are made using
    [Markdown](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx)
    as I felt this would not only give the website a consistent look,
    but it would also be very easy to add new pages whenever I wanted.
    
    Of course, there are also many custom components made by me,
    which can be imported into the markdown .mdx file format like a regular .jsx/ .tsx page.
    This includes the gallery on the right as well as templates to easily set up pages like this one.

    Generally, I had no trouble creating this website,
    as Next.js is very easy to use,
    providing a very useful set of custom components
    as well as an understandable, automatic routing, file system.
